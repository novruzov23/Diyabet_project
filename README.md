Business Problem
Predict whether people have diabetes or not when their characteristics are specified.
It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can Model
data analysis and feature engineering steps required before development. You are expected to perform.

Dataset Story
The dataset is part of a larger dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the US. in the USA
Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the State of Arizona.
These are the data used for diabetes research.
The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates a positive diabetes test result, and 0 indicates a negative diabetes test result.

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Step 1: Examine the general picture.
Step 2: Capture numerical and categorical variables.
Step 3: Analyze numerical and categorical variables.
Step 4: Perform target variable analysis. (Average of target variable according to categorical variables,
average of numerical variables)
Step 5: Perform an outlier observation analysis.
Step 6: Perform missing observation analysis.
Step 7: Perform correlation analysis.

Task 2: Feature Engineering
Step 1: Take the necessary action for missing and outlier values. There are no missing observations in the data set, but Glucose, Insulin etc.
Observation units containing 0 values ​​in variables may represent missing values. For example; a person's glucose or insulin level is 0
It won't happen. Considering this situation, we assign the zero values ​​as NaN in the relevant values ​​and then calculate the missing values.
You can apply operations to values.
Step 2: Create new variables.
Step 3: Perform the encoding operations.
Step 4: Standardize numerical variables.
Step 5: Create the model.
